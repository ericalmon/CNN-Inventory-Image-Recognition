# CNN-Inventory-Image-Recognition

In this project at CBRE, I build a convolutional neural network with the end deliverable of being able to recognize real estate-related images and assign a regulatory code to these images. 

This later uploaded to the cloud as an Azure-based web app. It classified real estate images which were uploaded by field technicians to Azure blob storage.
