# CNN-Inventory-Image-Recognition

In this project at CBRE, I built a convolutional neural network with the end deliverable of being able to recognize real estate-related images and assign a regulatory code classifer - the Uniformat ii. This saved the tedious process of manually labelling and processing thousands of images.  

This later uploaded to the cloud as an Azure-based web app. It classified real estate images which were uploaded by field technicians to Azure blob storage.
